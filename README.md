### The steps of this program.
#### 1. pre_process_0801.py --> doing preprocessing of raw data (merge_result.csv) and temporarily turn Y data into 0/1.

#### 2. get_model.py --> use Elastic Net to get best parameters for preliminary feature selections. (Get 59 features this step)

#### 3. mp_analysis_0910.py --> the strategy I use is to randomly select 2 to 10 features from the preliminary feature selections set and train 7 models to see the averaged performance. Ultimately, I store it into mp_res_0910.py.

#### 4. seq_sel_0911.py --> sequentially select and add the features from the previous top 10 performances until the accuracy doesn't improve. I use 7 models to cross validate the performance. Ultimately, 

#### 5. zip.py (zip.ipynb) --> finally, I transform the Y data back to original data and use the Zero inflated model to evaluate the features performance.
